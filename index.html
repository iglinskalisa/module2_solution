			<h2>Sonet #1</h2>
			<p>Mine eye hath play’d the painter and hath stell’d
			Thy beauty’s form in table of my heart;
			My body is the frame wherein ’tis held,
			And perspective it is the painter’s art.</p>

			<h2>Sonet #2</h2>
			<p>When my love swears that she is made of truth	
			I do believe her, though I know she lies,
			That she might think me some untutor’d youth,
			Unlearned in the world’s false subtleties.

			<h2>Sonet #3</h2>
			<p>From you have I been absent in the spring,
			When proud-pied April dress’d in all his trim
			Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
			That heavy Saturn laugh’d and leap’d with him.</p>
